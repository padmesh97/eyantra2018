The project aims in the audio processing with two tasks:

> 1.)Notes Detection

> 2.)Onset and Offset duration extraction from audio.

The tasks have been accomplished by using extensive mathematical and data visualization libraries of python which are 
___numpy,scipy,matplotlib and sms-master-tools___ used exclusively for audio processing.

Two versions have been worked upon dedicated to the task in which:

-> The results for v1_0 show confidence of __94%__.

-> The results for v2_0 show confidence of __96%__.
