The project aims in the audio processing with two tasks:
1.)Notes Detection
2.)Onset and Offset duration extraction from audio.

The tasks have been accomplished by using extensive mathematical and data visualization libraries of python which are 
numpy,scipy,matplotlib and sms-amster-tools used exclusively for audio processing.

Two versions have been worked upon dedicated to the task in which:
-> The results for v1_0 show confidence of 94%.
-> The results for v2_0 show confidence of 96%.
